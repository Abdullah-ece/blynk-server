Hi there,<br>
<br>
Nice app you made with Blynk!<br>
<br>
Here is what's next:<br>

<ul>
    <li>For Static Provisioning you need to upload Auth Tokens provided in this email to your devices. Tokens are in the attachment.</li>

    <li>During the provisioning process, device will be connected to your network. You need to scan provided QRs in order to connect your app to devices.
